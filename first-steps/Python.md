## Very first steps in Python

Python is an interpreted, dynamic language. It is shipped with most if not all
Linux distributions.

Python has multiple implementations. The best-known one is Cython.

Python scripts can be executed with Cython like this:

    $ python scriptname.py

and with another implementation called "PyPy" like this:

    $ pypy scriptname.py
